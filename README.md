### About Me:

Hi, I'm codeleaded,
a systems-level developer who enjoys building software that is fast, lightweight, and close to the metal.

I really like many programming languages from different categories:

### Low-Level Languages:

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%23-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)

Projects in these languages are mostly not provided in this profile because its purpose is to showcase implementations in **C**.

### Why C ?

I primarily work with **C** because I love how powerful and fast it is, while giving the programmer a high level of control over the hardware — especially memory and code execution.
In **C**, everything is explicit, clear, and readable.
The downside of **C** is its age and the minimal standard libraries.

Solving this problem is my main goal by implementing projects that are built by hand using only a few libc functions from headers like **stdio.h**, **stdlib.h**, **string.h**, etc.
Many functions provided by these headers have equivalent implementations in my library collection, e.g., intrinsic functions like **memcpy** and **memset**, or formatting/parsing functions like **sprintf**, **itoa**, etc.

---

### How is the library collection structured ?

Building libraries, abstracting behavior, and later reusing them is the core of programming.
This is why the library collection is separate, and every project uses absolute paths that point to the headers.
The library collection consists only of C header files (header-only). The reason is that this keeps the code compact and well structured (separating the C code into **.h** and **.c** files would be easy if needed).

The prefix **Cmd_** indicates a command-line–like implementation of the tool — no GUI, no window, etc.
Implementations with **Gui_**, on the other hand, always contain a window or other GUI components.

Not every library is defined for every combination of architecture and operating system.
Most projects are built for **x64**, **Ubuntu (GNU/Linux)**, and some for **Windows (10/11)**.
**macOS** and **Emscripten** are not supported (yet).
