I'm **codeleaded**,
a systems-level developer who enjoys building software that is fast, lightweight, and close to the metal.

I primarily work with **C** and **C++**, but I also explore other low-level languages like **Rust**, **Assembly**, and even custom DSLs for compilers and interpreters.

---

### 🛠️ What I like working on:

- **Operating systems** (kernels, bootloaders, userspace tools)
- **Low-level graphics** (OpenGL, shaders, rendering pipelines)
- **Custom compilers** and interpreters (parsers, bytecode, codegen, optimization)
- **Systems tools** like package managers, terminals, file utilities
- **Memory management**
- Building things that most users never see – but that power everything they use

---

### 📚 Interests & Learning:

- **Unix/Linux internals** – signals, syscalls
- **Linkers and loaders** – ELF binaries, static/dynamic linking
- **Cross-compilation** and embedded systems
- Reverse engineering, debugging, and binary tools (`objdump`, `gdb`, `lldb`)
- Systems security

### 💡 Philosophy

> "Know your tools. Understand your machine. Then build things that matter."

I believe in writing software that is:
- **Understandable** – even at the assembly level
- **Portable** – across machines, distros, or hardware
- **Minimal** – fewer dependencies, more control
- **Performant** – because waste scales

---

### 🧰 Tools & Languages

- **Languages**: C, C++, Rust, Assembly (x86_64, NASM), Shell
- **Tools**: `make`, `clang`, `gcc`, `gdb`
- **Platforms**: Linux (Ubuntu), QEMU, WSL
- **Misc**: Git, VSCode, custom build systems, Docker, TTY-level tools

---

### 🔧 Some things I like building:
- Experimental kernels and bootable ISOs
- Self-hosting compilers
- Raymarching demos with OpenGL shaders
- Static CLI tools with no external dependencies
- Tiny libc replacements or POSIX wrappers

Feel free to explore my projects or reach out if you’re working on something low-level, weird, or compiler-y.
